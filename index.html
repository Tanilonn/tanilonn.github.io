	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>
		Humans and dogs – we’ve been friends, protecting each other for more than fifteen thousand years by now. This is a special connection that no other animal has with humans. This is why there are people like me – I am Ewelina Nierzwicka, a dog psychologist. I devote my life to taking care of the friendship between a human and a dog – making sure that both sides of this friendship remain happy and safe. If your dog has problems like separation anxiety, constant barking at strangers who appear by the door (or maybe even a single doorbell is all it takes to turn your pampered pooch into a pet peeve?) and many many more – I am the person who can help with that.
I’m also here to make your life easier. If you have a busy schedule and you don’t always have the time for long beach strolls with your dog, I’m there for that as well. Your dog will get the exercise it needs, and in return be a lot happier and more relaxed and obedient at home. During the one-hour walks the dogs get to swim, run and play to their desire.
